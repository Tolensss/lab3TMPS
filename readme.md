# About the app
The Employee Management System project is a software application that allows users to manage employees in a company. It uses various design patterns such as the Composite pattern for creating employee hierarchies, the Decorator pattern for adding additional functionality to employee objects, the Facade pattern for providing a simplified interface to the system, and the Flyweight pattern for reducing memory usage by sharing common data between objects. The system allows users to add, remove, and update employee data, perform performance reviews, and pay employees.

## Objectives

1. Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns.
2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work,
   think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user.
3. Implement some additional functionalities, or create a new project
   using structural design patterns.

## Used Design patterns

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
